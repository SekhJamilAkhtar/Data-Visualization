## Added Columns
Several columns were introduced to augment the analysis and visualization of the data:
- **Project Duration (Months)**: Calculated duration in months between project start and end dates.
- **Project Duration (Years)**: Calculated duration in years between project start and end dates.
- **Total Award Amount**: Sum of award amounts for each project.
- **Geographical Region**: Classification of projects based on the org_state column.
- **Collaboration Indicator**: Binary column indicating project collaboration.

## Process Overview
The creation of the dashboard encompassed the following stages:

### Data Import and Cleanup
- Imported NIH research data into Power BI.
- Handled missing values and formatted columns for accurate analysis.

### Column Addition
- Introduced columns for project duration (months and years), total award amount, geographical region, and collaboration indicator.

### Visualization Design
- Devised slicers for fiscal year and country selection.
- Crafted three stacked column bar charts: award vs. project title, award vs. project duration (years), and total cost vs. award type.
- Formulated two stacked bar charts: project duration (months) vs. project ID and department type vs. total cost.
- Created a pie chart: organization name vs. percentage of award amount.

### Title and Documentation
- Included the title "NIH Research Insights Dashboard" in the final dashboard.
- Produced detailed documentation outlining the project, insights, user benefits, added columns, and the step-by-step process.

## Conclusion
The "NIH Research Insights Dashboard" emerges as a potent tool for exploring and comprehending NIH-funded research projects. Through its interactive visualizations, filtering options, and meaningful insights, users can make informed decisions, unearth patterns, and extract valuable knowledge from the data. This project underscores the potential of data analysis to offer actionable insights in the realm of research funding and resource allocation.
